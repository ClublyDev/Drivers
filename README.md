# Drivers App - Simon Barrett 2023


Full Stack Developer
 Technical Exercise

We would like you to create a react application that lists out drivers and menu items from the relevant data files and displays them on the page. The application should make use of react components.
There is a wireframe image included in the ZIP file, showing how we would like the page to be laid out.
The application should have a header bar, displaying the Logistics UK logo. 
Down the left-hand side of the page, the menu items should be displayed, the data for the menu items sits in the data/menu.json file.
In the main content container, there should be a listing containing; the drivers name, the registration of the vehicle he used and a sum of all the minutes they have spent on activities for the week (1/2/2021 â€“ 7/2/2021). There should also be a box to represent each day of the week. If the driver has a trace for that day with activities, the box should be filled in green, otherwise it can be left clear.
All the data for the listing can be obtained from the data/drivers.json file.
Bonus Tasks:
Add a search box to the page, and upon typing in the input field, the driver list should be filtered down based on matching name, or registration.
Split the total activity time in the listing into totals groups by individual activity types (drive, rest etc...)
Add routing to the application and create holding pages for the menu items.
Upon completion:
Please present your deliverables (prototypes/source files/solution files, etc.) in a zip file and email to Chris Stokes - cstokes@fta.co.uk. The application should be able to be run from NPM commands.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
